#System Requirements
- An i3 or better processor. The faster the better, especially at high video resolutions.
- 2 GB or more RAM.
- At least 100 MB Free Disk space
- Windows 7 or later, OS X 10.8 or later (has only been tested on 10.9), Linux 3.0+

# Installation
First you must install the following libraries on your computer

   - [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) version 2.4.10+ 
   - [Python](https://www.python.org/) 2.7.10 (or any later Python 2.x) ([See Installation on OS X if using a Mac](#installation-on-os-x)) 
   - [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) 1.8.0 (or any later Numpy)  

#Installation on OS X
Apple uses a prior version of Python that does not support the latest Python libraries. One work around is to install Python with Homebrew:

`$ brew install python`

Replacing Apple's system Python with an unsupported version may break things. Therefore we linked Homebrew's Python into the system path without replacing the system Python:

`$ ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.x.y/bin/python /bin/hbpython`

Where 2.x.y is the version number of your Python.
